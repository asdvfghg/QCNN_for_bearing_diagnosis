# Attention-embedded Quadratic Network (Qttention) for Effective and Interpretable Bearing Fault Diagnosis
This is the repository of our submission for IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement   "Attention-embedded Quadratic Network (Qttention) for Effective and Interpretable Bearing Fault Diagnosis". Here is the preprint vision [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00390.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00390.pdf).
In this work,

1. We propose a simple and effective model that is made of quadratic neurons for bearing fault diagnosis. The quadratic neurons directly augment the model to outperform other state-of-the-arts in noisy data settings. Different from previous structural modifications, our innovation is at the neuronal level, applying different neurons to bearing fault diagnosis and upgrading CNNs-based bearing fault diagnosis models. 
2. Methodologically, we derive the qttention mechanism from quadratic neurons, which greatly facilitates the understanding to the model made of quadratic neurons, with an emphasis on the model's physics mechanism when combined with envelope spectrum analysis.



All experiments are conducted with Windows 10 on an Intel i9 10900k CPU at 3.70 GHz and one NVIDIA RTX 3080Ti 12GB GPU. We implement our model on Python 3.8 with the PyTorch package, an open-source deep learning framework.

## Quadratic Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)

### Quadratic Neurons
A quadratic neuron was proposed by [1], It computes two inner products  and  one  power  term  of  the  input  vector  and  integrates them for a nonlinear activation function. The output function of a quadratic neuron is expressed as 

![enter description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdvfghg/image/master/小书匠/1641001696385.png),

where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is a nonlinear activation function, $\odot$ denotes the Hadamard product, $\boldsymbol{w}^r,\boldsymbol{w}^g, \boldsymbol{w}^b\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are weight vectors, and $b^r, b^g, c\in\mathbb{R}$ are biases. When $\boldsymbol{w}^g=0$, $b^g=1$, and $\boldsymbol{w}^b=0$, a quadratic neuron degenerates to a conventional neuron:  $\sigma(f(\boldsymbol{x}))= \sigma(\boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{w}^{r}+b^{r})$. 

### QCNN Structure
We propose a quadratic neuron empowered 1DCNN for bearing fault diagnosis. Specifically, the QCNN substitutes the conventional convolution with the quadratic convolution operations in convolutional layers. Structurally, we inherit the structure of the WDCNN [2] as the structure of the proposed model because the WDCNN is a well-established model whose design has been considered by many follow-up studies. This structure stacks 6 CNN blocks and 1 fully-connected layer.

### Qttention
We find that a quadratic neuron also contains an attention mechanism, referred to as *qttention*, by factorizing the learned quadratic function in analogue to attention. Mathematically, we factorize the expression of a quadratic neuron as follows (we remove constant terms for conciseness):

Such that, we can recover the qttention map of each layer through the above equations. The workflow of qttention map are shown as follows.

### Datasets
We use the CWRU dataset [3] and HIT dataset in our article. The CWRU dataset is a public bearing fault dataset  that can be found in [CWRU Dataset](https://github.com/s-whynot/CWRU-dataset).

### How to Use

Our deep learning models use **Weight & Bias** for training and fine-tuning. It is the machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. [Here](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) is a quick start for Weight & Bias. You need to create an account and install the CLI and Python library for interacting with the Weights and Biases API:
```
pip install wandb
```
Then login 
```
wandb login
```

After that, you can run our code for training.

1. For noisy data, you need to generate train dataset and test dataset by running ```data_split.py```.

2. Run ```train.py``` to train a QCNN or WDCNN model. First, you need to fill in your username in the wandb initialization function:
	```
	wandb.init(project="bearinganomaly", entity="username")
	```
	The results will be saved to your **Weight & Bias** project online.  

3. Run ```qttention.py``` to show the qttention map of the QCNN. The results will be saved to the ***'data'*** folder.
 


## Main Results
### Classification Performance
Here we give the main results of our paper. We use the false positive rate (FPR), fault detection rate (FDR), presicion (PRE) and F1 score to validate the performance of the proposed method. All resutls are run 5times to calculate the average. The proposed method outperforms other compared baseline methods.

### Interpretable Qttention Maps
The qttention maps derived from the QCNN inference process. Note that the QCNN pays attention to significant fault-related vibration signals.
